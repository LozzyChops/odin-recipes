    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>These crispy oven-baked kale chips are a great homemade snack. You cannot stop at just eating one, just like potato chips. Great for parties, too.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 bunch kale</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon flaked sea salt</li>    
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>With a knife or kitchen shears carefully remove kale leaves from the thick stems and tear into bite size pieces. Wash and thoroughly dry kale with a salad spinner. Drizzle kale leaves with olive oil and toss to combine. Spread out in an even layer on the baking sheet without overlapping and sprinkle with salt.</li>
        <li>Bake until the edges start to brown but are not burnt, 20 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
